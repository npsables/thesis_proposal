\section{Conclusion}

In this stage, we have learnt about blockchain, modern cryptography and DeFi. Also, we study some necessary knowledge about number theory to understand the math behind cryptography algorithms. The whole DeFi ecosystem is widely massive and still developing, while blockchain is not commonly used yet apart from cryptocurrencies. The need for cryptography is crucial since it distinguishes blockchain from other distributed database and secures the user wallet.


\section{Future work}

In the next stage, we will carry out the following tasks:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Analyze the CKD function of Secp256k1, proposed in BIP-0032 (\href{https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki}{Github})
  \item Create a CKD function for Ed25519 and prove its correctness
  \item Implement the proposed CKD function into a wallet
\end{itemize}
