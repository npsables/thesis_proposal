\section{Technology used}
{\textit {\textbf{Programing language}}}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{ReactJS}[ref react] for User Interface components. 
\item \emph{Node.js}[ref node] for Server components. 
\item \emph{Python}[ref Python] for automation testing.
\end{itemize}

{\textit {\textbf{Blockchain}}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Solana}[ref Solana] DevNet and TestNet. 
\end{itemize}

\section{System design}
{\textit {\textbf{Wallet type}}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We decided to build a \emph{Hybrid Wallet}. 
    The private key will be hold by only the user, save on user hardware (phone or computer).
    User have full control of their tokens or coins but they have to manage it on their own.
    Outside of the application, user must keep their private key safe.
\end{itemize}

{\textit {\textbf{Signature Schema}}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item EDDSA (Curve Ed25519) and key generation.
\end{itemize}

{\textit {\textbf{Main function of the wallet}}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Key generation.
    \item Key management.
    \item Asset management.
    \item Transfer management.
\end{itemize}
