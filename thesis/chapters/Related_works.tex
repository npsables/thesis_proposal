Our topic is not entirely new to the Blockchain community.
There tons of paper proposed the same problem as ours.
We analyzed the paper Towards on Blockchain Data Privacy Protection (Zexu Wang, Bin Wen and Ziqiang Luo) and find a very interesting approach to the wallet technical architecture. 
The paper focused on wallet keys protocols, like tree structure of the HD wallet, rules of deriving child keys from given parent keys, system privacy and how to establish a secure collaboration in blockchain network.
We may or may not implement their methods in our thesis since we haven't examine the impact of attacks on their complete system architecture. There are no number prove that their proposed system are perfectly secure.
In practice, BIP32 of Bitcoin wallet is widely used but the methods can not apply to Edwards curve. 
This is a great example of constructing a parent-child keys derivation. We will mention more of BIP32 on our final thesis report.
