On the Internet, most of the financial application apply the public key cryptography to verify users's identities, manage their digital assets, authenticate and authorize users, etc. In a blockchain environment, this model is crucial to keep the system works, since there are no intermediaries nor the central database for management. However; the user has to keep track of a lot of key pairs and this is not efficient.

To solve this problem, we use an HD wallet, which can derive hundreds of child wallets from a single master key-pair. Currently, there are already multiple protocols for an HD wallet for Secp256k1 while those for Ed25519 are neither well-known nor well developed. In this thesis, we will try to analyze and build an HD wallet for Ed25519 signature schema.
