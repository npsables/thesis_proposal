On the Internet, most of the financial application apply public key cryptography to verify users' identity, manage their digital asset, authenticate and authorize users, etc. In a blockchain environment, this model is crucial to keep the system works, since there are no intermediaries nor the central database for management. However; the user has to keep track of a lot of key pairs and this is not efficient.
To solve this problem, we use HD wallet, which can derive hundreds of child keys from a single master key-pair. Currently, there are already multiple protocols for HD wallet for Secp256k1 while those of ed25519 are neither well known nor well developed. In this thesis, we will try to analyze and build a complete HD wallet for ed25519.
