The completion of this study could not have been possible without the guidance and expertise of our supervisors. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to professor Nguyen An Khuong for his patience, motivation, and the immense amount of knowledge he led us to. No matter how many times we let him down because of our unprofessional result, he is still calm and continues to support us. We also want to thank the special supports from Mr.Phan Son Tu, who share with us valuable knowledge about the blockchain industry application while letting us work in his office.

Besides that, we would like to show our appreciation to families and friends, who have greatly supported and encouraged us in this thesis and university life.
